part 2: 
1. the value of i will be printed which is 3, this is the length of prices array. 
2. error because discountedPrice is only accessible in for loop 
3. function logs last value assigned to the finalPrice variable to the console.the output of console.log(finalPrice) will be the discounted price of the last item in the prices array, rounded to two decimal places.
4. will return an array of discounted prices. output array of [50, 100, 150].This is because each price is multiplied by (1 - 0.5) to get the discounted price, which is then rounded to two decimal places and added to the discounted array.
5. throws reference error as i is declared only in scope of if statement
6. it will throw a refernce error as discountedPrice is inside another scope. 
7. will log 150 to the console because final discounted price of last item in prices array (300) is 150 after applying discount of 0.5
8. [50, 100, 150]
9.SyntaxError because i is not accessible outside the loop because of scope of constant.
10.error because length is not defined
11. [50, 100, 150]

a. student.name
b. student['Grad Year']
c. student.greeting()
d. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
e. student.courseLoad[0]

A. '32' :The + operator is used for concatenation of strings and numbers. In this case, the string '3' is concatenated with the number 2 to form '32'.
B. 1 :The - operator performs subtraction. In this case, the string '3' is converted to the number 3 and then subtraction with the number 2 is performed, resulting in 1.
C. 3 : The null value is treated as 0 in numeric operations. Therefore, 3 + 0 = 3.
D. '3null' : The + operator is used for concatenation of strings and numbers. In this case, the string '3' is concatenated with the string 'null'.
E. 4 : The true value is treated as 1 in numeric operations. Therefore, 1 + 3 = 4.
F. 0 :The false value is treated as 0 in numeric operations, and the null value is also treated as 0. Therefore, 0 + 0 = 0.
G. '3undefined' : The + operator is used for concatenation of strings and numbers. In this case, the string '3' is concatenated with the string 'undefined'.
H. NaN : The - operator performs subtraction. In this case, the string '3' is converted to the number 3 and then subtraction with the undefined value is performed, resulting in NaN (Not a Number).

14. 
A. true - The string '2' is converted to the number 2 and then compared to 1. 2 is greater than 1, so the result is true.
B. true - The strings are compared character by character from left to right. The first character of '2' is less than the first character of '1', so the result is true.
C. true - The == operator performs type coercion, so the string '2' is converted to the number 2 and then compared to the number 2.
D. false - The === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion, so the string '2' and the number 2 are of different types and not equal.
E. true - The == operator performs type coercion, so the true value is converted to the number 1 and then compared to the number 2.
F. false - The === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion, so the true value and the boolean value of 2 are of different types and not equal.

15. The == operator performs type coercion before comparison, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion.
